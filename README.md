# TwitterX
*A full-stack social media platform inspired by X, built to demonstrate real-world MERN stack engineering.*

---

## 📌 Overview

**TwitterX** is a full-stack social media application that replicates the core functionality of Twitter (X), focusing on **scalable backend design**, **clean API architecture** and **modern React-based UI**.

The project is built to simulate how a real-world social platform works end-to-end from authentication and data modeling to feed generation and user interactions with an emphasis on **production-ready practices rather than UI gimmicks**.

This project serves as a strong demonstration of **full-stack engineering fundamentals**, system flow understanding and backend-frontend integration.
